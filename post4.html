            <h2>Top 10 everyday money saving tips</h2>
            <h3>Make your own presents</h3>
            <li>Handmade gifts are often much more that the item being given. They’re a demonstration of time, effort and
            thoughtfulness; anyone can go out and buy a pair of socks for you, but how many people will spend the time to knit you a
            pair? Something as simple as a hand-painted card can hold a surprising amount of sentimental value. You can even make
            preserved foods such as jarred fetta. Who doesn’t love marinated feta, personalised with their favourite spices?
            
            Best of all, it’s almost always cheaper to DIY. Start making presents yourself, and before you know it, you’ll be
            filling up both hearts and piggy banks.</li>
            <h3>write a shopping List</h3>
            <li>
                How many times have you strolled into the supermarket to buy ingredients for dinner, then walked out with a tub of fancy
                ice cream, two punnets of raspberries, a magazine, 6kg of Himalayan rock salt (it was on special!), half the ingredients
                for dinner, and no cash left in your wallet?
                
                Writing a shopping list can be a foolproof way to avoid those supermarket slip-ups. Well, it’s not quite that easy.
                Anyone can write a shopping list, but sticking to it is the key to success. Treat your list as a sacred text, follow it
                to the letter, and it will help you stay on track.

            <h3>Find inspiration and keep it close</h3>
            <li>
                We get it. It’s easy to forget why you’re saving when you’re staring down the business end of happy hour on Friday
                afternoon. That’s why it makes sense to set a goal, and keep a reminder of that goal close at hand.
                
                Want to a trip to Hamilton Island? Or saving to do some renovations? Make an inspirational picture of your dream the
                lock screen image on your phone. Little memory aids like these will help to keep your saving goal present when
                temptation strikes.
