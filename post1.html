            <h2>Tips for Saving Money</h2>
            <h3>Make a budget</h3>
            <p>A budget is just a plan for your money. Think of it as a map to get you to your money goals. And you need a budget</p>
            <h3>Say goodbye to debt.</h3>
            <p>I’m not the only one who says ditching your debt is a top tip for saving money. But even if I was, I’d still shout it
            from the rooftops, because I’ve lived this.</p>
            <p>Donec eget nunc id lacus ultricies egestas. Curabitur eu turpis sed justo finibus efficitur.</p>
            <h3>Cut down on small treats</h3>
            <p>You don't have to cut out your daily coffee but there may be other small treats that you could cut out instead. In the
            end, saving does require discipline. That doesn’t mean you need to live as a joyless hermit in the woods somewhere.
            Rather, you just need to identify the everyday extravagances that you have that are adding up and try to dial them down</p>
