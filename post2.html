            <h3>Understanding Trend Analysis</h3>
            <p>Trend analysis tries to predict a trend, such as a bull market run, and ride that trend until data suggests a trend
            reversal, such as a bull-to-bear market. Trend analysis is helpful because moving with trends, and not against them,
            will lead to profit for an investor. It is based on the idea that what has happened in the past gives traders an idea of
            what will happen in the future. There are three main types of trends: short-, intermediate- and long-term.</p>
            <p>A trend is a general direction the market is taking during a specified period of time. Trends can be both upward and
            downward, relating to bullish and bearish markets, respectively. While there is no specified minimum amount of time
            required for a direction to be considered a trend, the longer the direction is maintained, the more notable the trend.</p>
            <p>Trend analysis is the process of looking at current trends in order to predict future ones and is considered a form of
            comparative analysis. This can include attempting to determine whether a current market trend, such as gains in a
            particular market sector, is likely to continue, as well as whether a trend in one market area could result in a trend
            in another. Though a trend analysis may involve a large amount of data, there is no guarantee that the results will be
            correct.</p>
